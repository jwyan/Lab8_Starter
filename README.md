# Lab 8 - Starter
1. I would fit the automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. It would not make sense and would instead waste a lot of time if I were to test my code before I push my code. It is also not the best idea to test after all development has been completed because it would be much hard to catch the bugs. 

2. No, I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output. 

3. No, I would not use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application. In this case, I would use end-to-end testing instead as it is on a larger scale. Unit testing is more efficient when there is only one expected output. 

4. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application. This is because this is a single individual component that is easily tested through unit testing.
